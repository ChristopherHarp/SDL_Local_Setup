## üîπ Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

‚úÖ **Python 3.11+ installed** ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
‚úÖ **Git installed** ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))  
‚úÖ **VS Code installed** ([Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))  

If you haven't installed these yet, follow the links above before continuing.


## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork the Repository**  

To maintain your own copy of the repository while still receiving updates from the original project, follow these steps:

1. **Go to GitHub** and fork the repository:  
   - Navigate to **[https://www.github.com/ChristopherHarp/SDL_Local_Setup](https://github.com/ChristopherHarp/SDL_Local_Setup)**  
   - Click **Fork** (this creates a copy in your GitHub account).  
2. **Clone your forked repository** in VS Code:  
   - Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).  
   - Type **"Git: Clone"** and select it.  
   - Enter your forked repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sdl-local-setup.git
     ```
   - Select a location on your machine and open it in VS Code.
3. **Alternatively, use the terminal:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sdl-local-setup.git
   cd sdl-local-setup
   code .
   ```
4. **Set up the original repo as an upstream remote**:
   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/seeq12/sdl-local-setup.git
   ```
5. **Verify your remotes**:
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sdl-local-setup.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sdl-local-setup.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/seeq12/sdl-local-setup.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/seeq12/sdl-local-setup.git (push)
   ```

### üîπ Suggestion: Explain Why Upstream is Needed  
**Why set up `upstream`?**  
The original repository (`upstream`) may receive bug fixes, new features, or dependency updates.  
By setting `upstream`, you can pull the latest changes while keeping your modifications intact.  

### üîπ Suggestion: Reminder to Keep Fork Updated  
Since your fork is separate from the original repo, you‚Äôll need to **fetch and merge updates periodically**:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from upstream**:
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. **Merge changes into your local branch**:
   ```sh
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
3. **Push the updates to your fork**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

üöÄ **Now, your fork stays up to date with the original repository while keeping your modifications!**

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required VS Code Extensions**  

Before setting up the virtual environment, make sure you have the necessary VS Code extensions installed.

### **üîπ Installation Steps**  
1. Open **VS Code**  
2. Go to the **Extensions Marketplace** (`Ctrl + Shift + X` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd + Shift + X` on Mac)  
3. Search for and install the following extensions as required:
   - **Python** (by Microsoft)  
   - **Jupyter** (by Microsoft)

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Update VS Code User Preferences (Auto-Format on Save)**  

To ensure **consistent formatting** across your project, you need to update your **User Preferences (`settings.json`)** in VS Code.  

### **üîπ Steps to Update `settings.json`**
1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).  
3. Search for **"Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"** and select it.  
4. Inside the file, find the existing `{}` brackets and **add the following settings inside them**, making sure not to delete any existing settings:
```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
    }
}
```

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Logging into Customer Seeq Instances Locally**  

Instead of maintaining multiple credential files, this setup allows you to **store all credentials in a single `credentials.json` file** and **seamlessly switch customers** by modifying a single line in `__init__.py`.

Additionally, this method ensures that **local development mirrors production** as closely as possible, making it easier to deploy to customer environments **without code modifications**.

### **üîπ Requirements**
Ensure that the following files exist:  
‚úÖ **`_seeq_login.py`** in the **project root**  
‚úÖ **`__init__.py`** inside each **subproject folder** (e.g., `./customer1/`, `./develop/`)  
‚úÖ **`credentials.json`** in the **project root**, with the following format:

```json
{
    "develop": {
        "server": "https://develop.seeq.dev",
        "access_key": "dev_access_key",
        "password": "dev_password"
    },
    "customer1": {
        "server": "https://customer1.seeq.dev",
        "access_key": "customer1_access_key",
        "password": "customer1_password"
    },
    "customer2": {
        "server": "https://customer2.seeq.dev",
        "access_key": "customer2_access_key",
        "password": "customer2_password"
    }
}
```
### **üîπ Set the Active Customer**
Modify `DEFAULT_CUSTOMER` inside the `__init__.py` file **inside the customer‚Äôs folder** (e.g., `./customer1/__init__.py`).  
This ensures each customer has its own authentication settings. 

```python
DEFAULT_CUSTOMER = "customer1"  # Change to "customer2", "develop", etc.
```
**If `DEFAULT_CUSTOMER` is not modified, it will default to `'develop'`.**

---

### **üîπ ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Modify `_seeq_login.py`**
`_seeq_login.py` automatically loads credentials based on `DEFAULT_CUSTOMER` within the`__init__.py` file , so you **do not need to modify this file**.

### **üîπ Do Not Upload to Customer Instances**
To prevent accidental uploads, add these files to your `.gitignore`:

```
__init__.py
_seeq_login.py
```

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Using VS Code and Select the Correct Interpreter**  

1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).  
3. Type: **Python: Select Interpreter**.  
4. Select the Python interpreter inside your virtual environment:  
   ```
   .venv/bin/python  (Mac/Linux)  
   .venv\Scripts\python.exe  (Windows)  
   ```

When selecting the Python interpreter, **choose the one named `.venv`**.  
If it does not appear in the list, restart VS Code and try again.

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Running Jupyter in VS Code**  

If you're using **VS Code‚Äôs Jupyter extension**, you can open a `.ipynb` file directly within VS Code. However, note that some ipyvuetify components might not render correctly in this environment.

### **Alternative: Launching JupyterLab**  

If you encounter rendering issues with ipyvuetify content or prefer the full browser-based interface, you can launch JupyterLab:

1. Open the terminal in VS Code (**Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + `**).
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```
3. JupyterLab will automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn‚Äôt, you can manually navigate to:
   ```
   localhost:8888/lab
   ```

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Running Voila in JupyterLab to Render an Add-on**

If you are developing an Add-on and want to render the notebook in Add-on Mode, you can install the Jupyter extension `voila-dashboard-jupyterlab-preview`.

### Steps to Install and Use Voila in JupyterLab:

1. Launch JupyterLab by running the following command:
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. Enable the **Extension Manager** within the **Settings** tab.

3. Install the extension `voila-dashboard-jupyterlab-preview`.

4. To render a notebook in Add-on Mode:
   - **Right-click** the desired notebook, select **Open With**, and choose **Voila Preview**.
   - Alternatively, use the **Voila** icon in the Jupyter notebook toolbar to launch the notebook in Add-on Mode.

## üéØ **Troubleshooting**  

### **Issue: Widgets do not render**  
**Fix:** Run:  
```sh
pip install --force-reinstall jupyterlab_widgets widgetsnbextension
```

### **Issue: Jupyter Notebook can't find Python kernel**  
**Fix:** Run:
```sh
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv
```
Then restart VS Code and reselect the Python interpreter.
